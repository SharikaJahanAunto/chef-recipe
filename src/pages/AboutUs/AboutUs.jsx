            <p>BD FOOD was founded in 2021 by a group of food enthusiasts who wanted to create a space where people could discover and learn about Bangladeshi cuisine. We believe that food is not just about sustenance, but also about culture, community, and creativity. We wanted to create a platform that celebrates the artistry and passion of Bangladeshi chefs, and helps them to connect with audiences around the world.</p>

            <p>Our team is made up of food lovers, technologists, and entrepreneurs who are passionate about bringing people together through food. We work closely with our partner chefs to curate their menus and showcase their unique talents.
